## About

`matestack-ui-vuejs` ships all you need to build **reactive** UIs in **pure Ruby** orchestrating prebuilt Vue.js components with a simple Ruby DSL.&#x20;

The prebuilt reactive components built **on top of Vue.js** are covering typical features of a reactive web UI, such as async form submission, dynamic page transitions or async partial UI updates. **No Opal involved**

If required, it can be easily extended with pure JavaScript.

### Why matestack-ui-vuejs?

`matestack-ui-vuejs` was created because modern web app development became more and more complex due to the rise of JavaScript frontend frameworks and the SPA frontend/REST API/JSON backend architecture. This sophisticated approach might be suitable for big teams and applications but is way to complex for most of small to medium sized teams and application scopes.

In contrast, `matestack-ui-vuejs` helps Rails developers creating modern, reactive web apps while focusing on **simplicity**, **developer happiness** and **productivity**:

* [x] Use Rubyâ€™s amazing language features while creating your UI
* [x] Skip using templating engine syntax and write pure Ruby instead
* [x] Reduce the amount of required JavaScript in order to build reactive web UIs
* [x] Create a single application, managing the full stack from database to a reactive UI in pure Ruby
* [x] **Drastically reduce the complexity of building reactive web applications**

### What makes matestack-ui-vuejs different?

[Hotwire](https://hotwire.dev) and [Stimulus Reflex](https://docs.stimulusreflex.com) are awesome gems. They reduce the amount of required JavaScript when implementing reactive web UIs. They allow us to use more Rails and less JavaScript. **Great!**

Matestack, developed since 2018, goes even one step further: **Use more Ruby and less of everything else** (JavaScript, ERB/HAML/SLIM, CSS).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why?** Because Ruby is just beautiful! More Ruby = More developer happiness = Higher productivity

Additionally, most of `matestack-ui-vuejs` does not require Action Cable or Redis, but can optionally use the power of these tools.
